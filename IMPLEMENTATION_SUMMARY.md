# Summary of Game Invite Implementation

## Changes Made to Chat-Service Backend

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

- Added `GAME_INVITE` to the `MessageType` enum
- Added GIF support fields to the `Message` model (gifUrl, gifTitle, gifThumbnail, gifProvider)
- Created migration file to sync with existing database state

**Migration**: `prisma/migrations/20251001093726_add_gif_support/migration.sql`

### 2. Type Definitions
**File**: `src/types/message.types.ts` (NEW)

Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:
- `BaseMessage` - Base interface for all messages
- `PrivateSendMessage` - Private chat messages
- `LobbyJoinMessage`, `LobbyLeaveMessage`, `LobbySendMessage` - Lobby messages
- `UserBlockMessage` - Block/unblock messages
- `NotificationMessage` - Generic notification structure
- `NotificationType` - Union type including all game invite types:
  - `GAME_INVITE`
  - `GAME_INVITE_ACCEPTED`
  - `GAME_INVITE_DECLINED`
- Response message types for WebSocket events

### 3. Service Layer Updates
**File**: `src/services/privatechat.service.ts`

- Imported `NotificationMessage` type from message.types
- Enhanced `handleNotification` function with:
  - Detailed JSDoc documentation explaining supported notification types
  - Specific logging for game invite notifications
  - Proper handling of all game invite message types
  - Comments explaining the message flow

### 4. Documentation
**Files**: 
- `GAME_INVITES.md` (NEW) - Comprehensive documentation of the game invite feature

## How Game Invites Work

### Message Flow
1. **Sending an Invite**:
   - Frontend sends `notification/new` with type `GAME_INVITE`
   - Backend receives message through WebSocket
   - `chatHandler` routes to `handleNotification`
   - Notification is forwarded to recipient (if online)
   - Sender's other connections are updated

2. **Responding to Invite**:
   - Recipient sends `GAME_INVITE_ACCEPTED` or `GAME_INVITE_DECLINED`
   - Backend forwards response to original sender
   - Both users' states are updated via their WebSocket connections

### Key Features
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket communication
- ✅ Multi-connection support (same user on multiple devices)
- ✅ Blocked user protection
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Type-safe message handling
- ✅ Documentation included

## Frontend Integration
The frontend already supports:
- Sending game invites through chat menu
- Displaying game invite notifications
- Accept/decline buttons for invites
- State management for pending invites

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Schema updated with GAME_INVITE type
- [x] Prisma client regenerated
- [x] TypeScript types defined
- [x] Service layer enhanced with logging
- [x] No compilation errors
- [ ] Manual testing with two users (requires running services)
- [ ] Verify invite notification delivery
- [ ] Verify accept/decline response handling

## Files Modified
1. `/Chat-Service/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added GAME_INVITE enum value
2. `/Chat-Service/src/services/privatechat.service.ts` - Enhanced notification handler
3. `/Chat-Service/src/types/message.types.ts` - NEW - Type definitions
4. `/Chat-Service/GAME_INVITES.md` - NEW - Feature documentation
5. `/Chat-Service/prisma/migrations/20251001093726_add_gif_support/migration.sql` - NEW - Migration file

## Next Steps
To fully test the implementation:
1. Start the Chat-Service: `npm run dev`
2. Start the Frontend application
3. Login with two different users
4. Send a game invite from User A to User B
5. Verify the notification appears for User B
6. Accept/decline the invite as User B
7. Verify User A receives the response
